[Technical requirements](mid_senior.pdf)

### Remarks
1. Handling only some of the error in UI (for append only)
2. Didn't find which fields from backend could be nullable, so could be some crash as all DTO classes generated
   automatically and I didn't put ? after each of field. In real app we know which fields could be nullable

### What is not yet implemented but will be
1. Profiling for speedup compose startup
2. Some data/package structure refactoring
3. Unit tests
